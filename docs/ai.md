# Paramify AI

Paramify is introducing new opt-in AI features built with Llama, an open source AI model secured within the Paramify Cloud to prevent third party access. To opt-in contact your Client Success representative or our Sales team [here](https://www.paramify.com/contact-us).

Paramify does not use any of your data to train the model nor do we retain your data for future processing. Data is not processed by the AI model without the user explicitly executing the AI-specific features.

## The following AI features are currently in Alpha release:

### Risk Solution Generator

Paramify is introducing a Risk Solution generation tool to offer suggestions for creating Risk Solutions from your Custom Responses (control requirement specific response).

### Elements Generator

Paramify is introducing a Element generation tool to offer suggestions for potential Elements that are found in your Risk Solutions or Custom Responses (control requirement specific response).
