2. Define a version.
3. Provide a description.
4. Specify an Author (choose a party element from your library).
5. Set a date (default is the current date).
6. Click 'Save'.

Once the package is ready, you can download the zip file by clicking on the 'Download' button. This zip file will contain the OSCAL SSP along with all other project documents.

## Importing revision history
A historical SSP revision history prior to automating your SSP in Paramify can be imported as follows in Document Robot to ensure a complete revision history is captured in your Paramify generated documents:
1. Create a CSV with the revision history using the format shown in the table below
2. Click "Import Revision History"
3. Click "Choose File..." and select the CSV revision history file
4. Click "Submit"

The imported revision history will appear in the Document Robot page. Refresh the page if the revision history doesn't appear right away.

#### CSV Format to "Import Revision History"
| Date | Description | Version | Author |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1/2/2020 | First Draft | 1.0.0 | Author Name |

::: tip NOTE
Deliverables are not available for download for the revisions imported because the historical packages are not stored in Paramify.

## OSCAL Deliverables
Document Robot streamlines adopting OSCAL - the Open Security Controls Assessment Language by NIST.  This is crucial for automating information security design, audit, and reporting. In no time, it automates your OSCAL package, digitally formatting every component for optimal efficiency. Document Robot compiles all elements into the OSCAL file to optimize efficiency in security assessment and organization.
