## Overview

In a perfect world, everybody might be adept at producing and consuming OSCAL. In reality, human-readable documentation is still a necessity and each vendor represents their content differently. Consequently, it can be challenging to fit existing documentation into the OSCAL model while still maintaining consistent outputs.

This FAQ will help you navigate common questions and issues related to specific documents.

### Appendix A

::: details How do I model a "Hybrid" or "Shared" control origination?

Risk Solutions are **single origination** by design. Multi-responsibiliy Risk Solutions should be broken up for best results.

If you are converting legacy documentation into custom control responses, you can use a combination of originations to model a hybrid or shared control.

**Hybrid** is simply `System Provider Specific` AND `System Provider Corporate`.

**Shared** is a combination of system provider and customer originations.

- Example: `System Provider Specific` AND `Customer Provided`
- Example: `System Provider Corporate` AND `Customer Configured`
